### Slides

* [Introduction to Classical Machine Learning](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1lMMBvdT_0jVxyBAs-Qeq9jnhsvtGVDKo)
* [Deep Learning](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NDaSx8Y7Yfvlu_Hahahch8oFY0ecW8Pt/view?usp=sharing)

* [Case Studies](https://github.com/PJ7668/ml-for-ssa/blob/master/ML4SSA.pdf)

### Code

Code examples from the case studies can be found in the ipython notebook (ipynb) files. To execute the examples, you'll need to install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) and run them as jupyter notebooks. The notebooks assume that you have downloaded data into a `data` directory located in the directory containing your notebook files.

### Data

* Light curve examples come from http://alcdef.org/. Download the entire archive and unzip into an `data/ALCDEF_ALL` directory.
* TLE examples come from http://celestrak.com. Download each group txt file to a `data/tle` directory. These files will all be `txt` files.
